# API

repo-to-content exposes a small ESM library from `src/index.js` and a CLI from `src/cli.js`. The public surface is intentionally local-first so agents can call it in dry-run workflows without credentials.

## Stability

The V1 API is suitable for release-candidate testing. Treat output shapes as versioned review artifacts before wiring them into external executors.
